House Rental App using MERN stack (NM1042 AU Course Project). It includes real-time chat and request updates powered by Socket.io, along with geolocation services using the OpenMap API for text-to-geocode conversion and MongoDB for geocode lookups. The app supports user, owner, and admin roles with a secure verification system. File uploads are handled using Cloudinary and Multer, while a mock payment system enhances the rental process. 

The app is deployed on Render (it is running on the free tier, so when you click on the demo, it may take a few minutes to load due to cold start).
