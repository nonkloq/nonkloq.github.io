Tic-tac-toe AI impemented in JavaScript using [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm with customizable depth restriction and an option to toggle [alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning).

The game offers six different configurations, including three board sizes (3x3, 4x4, 5x5) and matching cell counts (3, 4, 5).

Additionally, it has a board state editing mode and a minimax search information box that displays search statistics, such as the number of explored nodes and other relevant details.
