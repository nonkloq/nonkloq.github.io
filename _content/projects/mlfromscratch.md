I implemented several machine learning algorithms from scratch in python using NumPy while learning them. 

This project includes many visualizations and comparisons showing how each algorithm learns.

The machine learning categories covered are **supervised learning**, **unsupervised**, **inductive learning**, and **ensemble learning**. Check out [this link](https://github.com/nonkloq/ml-from-scratch/blob/main/README.md) for the full list of implemented algorithms.
