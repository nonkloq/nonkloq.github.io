- Designed and deployed a real-time cough detection pipeline on resource-constrained hardware, achieving 97% accuracy and
96% F1-score using classical ML models; led end-to-end audio data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and iterative
model refinement.
-  Contributed to the development of voice-based health assessments, including GRBAS voice quality rating, delirium detection,
and [Type 2 Diabetes Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19204) models.
- Implemented a highly customizable dashboard framework with a custom data caching system, data processing pipelines,
and interactive visualizations to support diverse client requirements, enabling analysis from individual user health data to
cohort-level trends and summaries.
- Conducted exploratory analysis on large IoT datasets from individual users to cohorts and developed activity detection
algorithms.
